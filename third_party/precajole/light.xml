<!--

  <precajole-spec> is a list of <precajole> directives.

  <precajole> means: read the given file, cajole it, and
  associate the result with the uris listed.

  So when a gadget has <script src='...'>, and precajoling is
  enabled, and the uri is allowed by the uri policy, and the uri
  is in the precajoled list, then the cajoler will substitute the
  precajoled result without even fetching the uri.

  Any http: uri also implies an https: uri (but not vice versa).

  Since cajoling is kind of slow, this file 'light.xml' only
  lists a few small entries used for testing the precajoler.  The
  file 'heavy.xml' contains the full list of scripts precajoled
  for a full installation.
