This is jQuery 1.9.1.
The source distribution was obtained from <https://github.com/jquery/jquery.git>
at tag "1.9.1" = 28d946384799abcd7608c3beda898a0a11ac88d7.

The built jQuery in dist/ was obtained independently from
<http://jquery.com/download/>, rather than locally building, to avoid needing
to install the required build tools.

Some tests in proxytests.html have been disabled due to ES5/3 not supporting
them. Other changes necessary are marked with comments "Patched for Caja".
