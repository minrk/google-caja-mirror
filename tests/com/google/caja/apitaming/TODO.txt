=== general notes ===

- The google.events APIs only work cajoled when 'src' is a tamed host object,
  not an object created by the guest in the guest frame. This is adequate for
  the idiomatic use case of the API, but we should investigate and fix.


=== visualization taming issues ===

- datatable.html - tooltip on the legend does not show up in ES5 mode;
  shows up ok in ES5/3 mode.

- DataTable.prototype.toJSON fails with stack overflow when in ES5/3 mode. It
  seems impossible to avoid this by "scrubbing" the objects passed into the
  various methods. Also DataTable.clone().

- AnnotatedTimeLine data is garbled (order of data points incorrect) in
  ES5(SES). Other displays (e.g. Table) of the same data show it to be just
  fine, indicating there might be a problem with sorting inside the gViz code
  itself that's affected by something we're doing.

- Intermittently: GeoMap and IntensityMap don't work in ES5/3, and
  testGeoChart* does not seem to work in ES5/3 and ES5. Works fine when these
  are the only tests on the page, and in all cases when used uncajoled.

- Geometry is somewhat different cajoled vs. uncajoled, when the supplied
  container <div>s are given a fixed height. Uncajoled, the graphs size to
  fit the height of the container <div>. Cajoled, the graphs maintain their
  preferred size.


=== maps taming issues ===

Fusion tables -- we treat the ID of the Fusion Table as a bearer token cap that
  is granted by some means to the guest code; as such, we don't pass it thru the
  URI policy.

Panoramio layer -- ambiently grants ability to contact the outside world via
  the Panoramio Website (I guess...); need to think about this some more.
