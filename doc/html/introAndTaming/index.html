<div class="title">Using Caja</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Caja is a system which allows a host page to safely embed external
content.</p>

<p>Say you are running a social site where people can meet with their
friends. But your users want to run games on the site. The games are
code written by people you have never met and have no particular
reason to trust. These games need to interact with the users, via
their UI. They might also want to interact with your site, to post
high scores. You have some idea of what interactions a game is allowed
to have with your site, for example, it may only post one "high score"
notification per day, but may have no other access to the user's
resources on your site.</p>

<img src="socialSite.png"></img>

<p>Clearly, just running untrusted code on your site exposes you and
your users to all the bugs -- and evil -- that a game may harbor. You
could put each game in its own <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> on a
separate domain, but that means you need to host a separate, safe
domain for the games to be served from. And you incur the bother of
having to implement cross-domain messaging between the games and your
site, either via client-side hacks or server-side proxying.</p>

<p>Caja provides a better way. Using Caja, you can embed each game in
a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> directly within your site's page, and
interact with it via normal JavaScript objects. Caja lets you do this
safely, and gives you a place to stand to enforce your policies (such
as the "one notification per day" rule) via regular JavaScript code.

<dl>

  <dt>Host page</dt> <dd>A Web page that acts as a container for code
  it has no particular reason to trust. This page uses the Caja API to
  use that code safely and limit its authority.</dd>

  <dt>Host code</dt> <dd>Code running in the host page.</dd>
  
  <dt>Guest code</dt> <dd>Code that the host page includes from some
  external source it may or may not trust. This code needs to run with
  limited authority within the host page.</dd>

  <dt>Guest page</dt> <dd>For Caja, guest code is represented as a
  regular HTML page, possibly containing CSS and JavaScript. When an
  HTML page is used as guest code, it is called a <em>guest
  page</em>.</dd>
  
  <dt>Policy</dt> <dd>Your decisions about what you wish to allow 
  each piece of guest code to do.</dd>
  
</dl>

<p>To use Caja, you arrange your host page such that Caja creates a
secure boundary around the guest code. Among the objects in your host
page, you construct some which act defensively -- in other words,
their API assumes that their clients may be buggy or malicious. You
give the guest code access to these objects, and subsequently, you and
the guest code use these objects to cooperate. Caja provides a
<em>taming</em> of your defensive objects to make sure that guest code
can only use their published API.</p>

<img src="guestInsideHost.png"></img>

<dl>

  <dt>Defensive object</dt> <dd>An object in your host page that is
  constructed with caution to provide only a limited authority to its
  clients. Your host page grants limited authority to guest code by
  supplying it with the appropriate defensive objects. Taken together,
  the code in your defensive objects implements -- and thus enforces
  -- your policy.</dd>

  <dt>Taming</dt> <dd>Current JavaScript objects are not able to make
  themselves tamper-proof. <em>Taming</em> is the process of
  registering your defensive objects with Caja as you provide them to
  guest code, such that Caja ensures that only the published API of
  the objects. For example, Caja can ensure that guest code only calls
  your defensive object's methods, and cannot modify the object.</dd>
  
</dl>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>To use Caja effectively, you need to know some basics about how it
works. The following shows the major steps in how a page uses
Caja. Not all of them have to happen in the exact order shown, as you
will no doubt realize as you become more familiar with Caja.</p>

<h2>Include Caja, prepare target &lt;div&gt; and defensive objects</h2>

<img src="embeddingStep0.png"></img>

<p>The host code includes the main Caja script, prepares the defensive
objects, and constructs a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to receive the
guest code. The Caja script establishes a connection to the Caja
server as specified by its configuration. We supply a Caja server at
<code>http://caja.appspot.com/</code>, or you can download our code
and run your own.</p>

<h2>Tame objects and establish defensive DOM boundary</h2>

<img src="embeddingStep1.png"></img>

<p>The host code asks Caja to tame the defensive objects, and uses
Caja to construct a DOM boundary within the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
it has chosen.</p>

<h2>Ask Caja to cajole and run the code</h2>

<img src="embeddingStep2.png"></img>

<p>The host code asks Caja to run some guest code -- represented as
HTML with CSS and JavaScript -- within the supplied
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, supplying to that code the tamed defensive
objects previously constructed.</p>

<p>In order to run the code safely, Caja must transform it to make it
safe. It does this by sending a request to the Caja server, which
<code>GET</code>s the code and returns the transformed code. We call
the Caja transformation <em>cajoling</em>.</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Cajoling</dt> <dd>The process of making Web content -- HTML with
  CSS and JavaScript -- safe for inclusion in a host page running
  Caja. Cajoling involves adding inline checks to make sure the code
  does not break the invariants Caja needs, and ensuring that the code
  cannot refer to variables in the host page that are not explicitly
  given to it.</dd>
  
</dl>

<img src="embeddingStep3.png"></img>

<p>Caja then runs the code in the supplied <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
with the tamed defensive objects you specified.</p>

<h2>What the guest code sees</h2>

<p>From the viewpoint of the guest code, it runs with what seems to be
a W3C DOM compliant <code>document</code> object and an ECMAScript 5
compliant JavaScript virtual machine. Its <code>document</code> is
confined to the boundaries of the supplied <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
and its JavaScript globals, like <code>Object</code> and
<code>Array</code>, are its own and do not affect code outside it.</p>

<p>The tamed defensive objects are visible to guest code as additional
global variables in its top-level JavaScript context. For example, if
the host page provided a game with a tamed function for reporting a
top score under the name <code>sendTopScore</code>, the game code
would simply see a <code>sendTopScore</code> global variable and could
invoke it as a function in the usual manner.</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Imports</dt> <dd>The set of additional global variables provided
  to guest code allowing it to invoke the services of the host
  page. The host page specifies the names of the imports, and provides
  tamed defensive objects as their values.</dd>
  
</dl>

<h1>Your first Caja embedding</h1>

<p>The easiest way to learn to use Caja is to just do it! Caja does
not require that you download any software or run any servers. All you
need is a publicly visible Website to host your guest pages.</p>

<h2>Create a host page</h2>

<p>First create a host page; include the Caja boostrap script; create
a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> div for the UI of your guest page; and give
yourself a place to put your own code that interacts with Caja.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My first Caja host page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="http://caja.appspot.com/caja.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
      #guestdiv {
        width: 75%;
        min-height: 50px;
        border: 1px solid black;
        margin: 10px;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My first Caja host page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;div id="guest0" class="guestdiv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="hostpage.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Initially, where <code>hostpage.js</code> is still an empty
file, your page should look something like the following:</p>

<img src="hostpageStep0.tiff"></img>

<p>Now arrange to put your first guest page at some publicly available
URL. An example of a starter guest page would be the following:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My first Caja guest page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Assuming you put this guest page at the location
<code>http://example.com/guestpage.html</code>, you would include it
in your host page by writing, in <code>hostpage.js</code>, the
following:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var guestUrl = 'http://example.com/guestpage.html';
var guestDiv = document.getElementById('guest0');

caja.configure({                                                  // &#x2460;
  cajaServer: 'http://caja.appspot.com'                           // &#x2461;
}, function(frameGroup) {                                         // &#x2462;
  frameGroup.makeES5Frame(guestDiv, undefined, function(frame) {  // &#x2463;
    frame.run(guestUrl, undefined, function(result) {             // &#x2464;
      // Guest code is now running                                // &#x2465;
    });
  });
});
</pre>

<p>&#x2460; The script <code>caja.js</code> introduces one name into
the host page's global namespace, the symbol <code>caja</code>. This
object has one method, <code>configure</code>.</p>

<p>&#x2461; Pass to the <code>configure</code> method a map of
configuration parameters. As a minimum, pass the location of the Caja
server you are using, as shown. Make sure that your source for the
<code>caja.js</code> script, and your <code>cajaServer</code>
parameter, point to the same service. Do <em>not</em> attempt to make
a local copy of <code>caja.js</code>; it is crucially important for
your security that you always get the latest <code>caja.js</code>
according to the server you are using!</p>

<p>&#x2462; The <code>configure</code> method returns a <em>frame
group</em> object. A typical Caja host page need only create one frame
group. We will be using various methods of the frame group later on
but, for the moment, we will use only one of its methods.</p>

<p>&#x2463; The <code>makeES5Frame</code> method of the frame group
constructs a Caja <em>frame</em> to contain guest code running under
the ECMAScript 5 language and with a DOM <code>document</code>
confined to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> provided as
<code>guestDiv</code>.</p>

<p>&#x2464; The <code>run</code> method of the frame runs the
specified guest page inside the frame.</p>

<p>&#x2465; The callback specified to the <code>run</code> method is
invoked after the guest page is running. Conceptually, this callback
is invoked after <code>onload</code> in the guest page is called.</p>

<h1>API Reference</h1>

<h2><a name="api_caja">caja</a></h2>

<p>Sourcing the script <code>caja.js</code> places a singleton object,
<code>caja</code>, in the global namespace.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4><code>configure</code></h4>

<blockquote><code>caja.configure(params, callback)</code></blockquote>

<p><code>params</code> &mdash; a map of configuration parameters for
the Caja system. These include:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><code>cajaServer</code>: a string giving the URL of the Caja
server. This must match the location from which the
<code>caja.js</code> script was sourced. For example, if the script
was from <code>http://caja.appspot.com/caja.js</code>, then
<code>cajaServer</code> must, correspondigly, be
<code>http://caja.appspot.com/</code>.</p>

<p><code>debug</code>: a boolean indicating whether to configure Caja
for debugging. At this time, debugging support means that the Caja
infrastructure, and the cajoled code, will be pretty-printed for
readability, rather than minified for speed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><code>callback</code> &mdash; a unary function called back when the
method completes with one parameter, a <a href="#api_frameGroup">frame
group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
caja.configure({
  cajaServer: 'http://caja.appspot.com/',
  debug: false
}, function (frameGroup) {
  // use frameGroup
});
</pre>

<h2><a name="api_frameGroup">Frame Group</a></h2>

<p>A configured Caja context the members of which can share the same
set of tamed defensive objects. Most host pages will need to create
only one frame group.</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<h4><code>iframe</code></h4>

<p>A direct reference to the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> object used
for taming variables. Provided for diagnostics and testing only.
<strong>It is crucial for the security of your host page that you never inject
any code or other content into this frame, since you may easily break invariants
of the Caja system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TODO(ihab.awad):</strong> Should we just skip this?</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4><code>tame</code></h4>

<blockquote>
<code>aFrameGroup.tame(aDefensiveObject)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Tames a graph of defensive objects rooted at the supplied
object.</p>

<p><code>aDefensiveObject</code> &mdash; a defensive object to be
tamed. This object may have <a href="#api_tamingAnnotations">taming
annotations</a> on some of its components.</p>

<p>Returns a tamed object suitable for presenting to guest code,
representing the supplied defensive object.</p>

<h4><code>makeES5Frame</code></h4>

<blockquote>
<code>aFrameGroup.makeES5Frame(div, uriCallback, callback)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Creates a new ES5 frame.</p>

<p><code>div</code> &mdash; the HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> within
which Caja will construct a confined DOM <code>document</code> for the
guest page. This may be <code>undefined</code>, in which case the
frame may only be used to run JavaScript code (see below).</p>

<p><code>uriCallback</code> &mdash; a <a href="#api_uriCallback">URI
callback</a> object that is called whenever guest code attempts to
gain access to an external URI.</p>

<p><code>callback</code> &mdash; a unary function called back when the
method completes with one parameter, an <a
 href="#api_es5Frame">ES5 frame</a>.</p>

<h2 id="api_es5Frame">ES5 Frame</h2>

<p>A confined ECMAScript 5 JavaScript context, with an optional
confined DOM <code>document</code>.

<h3>Properties</h3>

<h4><code>iframe</code></h4>

<p>A direct reference to the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> object used
to run the code for this ES5 frame. Provided for diagnostics and
testing only. <strong>It is crucial for the security of your host page
that you never inject any code or other content into this frame, since
you may easily break invariants of the Caja system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TODO(ihab.awad):</strong> Should we just skip this?</p>

<h4><code>imports</code></h4>

<p>A reference to the set of global variables to be provided to guest
code in this frame.</p>

<p><strong>TODO(ihab.awad):</strong> Should we provide this directly?
If we do, for "advanced" use, we should document how to use it --
especially the fact that people have to call
<code>DefineOwnProperty___()</code> on it to add new imports.</p>

<h4><code>loader</code></h4>

<p>A reference to the module loader of this frame.</p>

<p><strong>TODO(ihab.awad):</strong> Should we provide this directly?
If we do, for "advanced" use, we should document how to use it. At the
moment, we don't really provide a "published" way for people to just
run modules against the imports of a frame. The <code>run</code>
method (see below) is "one-shot" only. Should think about flexibility
vs. API complexity here.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4><code>run</code></h4>

<blockquote>
<code>anES5Frame.run(url, extraImports, callback)</code>
</blockquote>

<p><code>url</code> &mdash; the URL of a guest page or guest
JavaScript program to run in this ES5 frame.</p>

<p><code>extraImports</code> &mdash; a set of extra imports to provide
to the guest code. These will become additional top-level variables
seen by the guest code.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var alertCount = 0;
var restrictedAlert = function(s) {
  if (alertCount > 3) { return; }
  alertCount++;
  alert(String(s));
};

anES5Frame.run('http://example.com/guestpage.html', {
    alert: aFrameGroup.tame(restrictedAlert)
  }, function (result) {
    alert('the guest page is loaded');
  });
</pre>

<h2 id="api_uriCallback">URI Callback</h2>

<p>An object that is called to determine whether, and how, guest code
should be allowed to gain access to external URIs.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4><code>rewrite</code></h4>

<blockquote>
<code>aUriCallback.rewrite(uri, mimeType)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Called to gate access of guest code to a given URI.</p>

<p><code>uri</code> &mdash; a fully qualified URI represented as a
string.</p>

<p><code>mimeType</code> &mdash; a MIME type string indicating the
expected type of the returned body from the URI, and thus indicating
the manner in which the returned body will be used. For example, Caja
might pass <code>image/*</code> to indicate that the URI's returned
body will be used as an image.</p>

<p>Returns a rewritten URI to be used for the actual access. May
return the same URI passed in to indicate access without
restriction. Returns <code>undefined</code> to indicate access
denied.</p>

<h2 id="api_tamingAnnotations">Taming Annotations</h2>

<h3>Automatic taming</h3>

<p>For the most part, Caja automatically tames objects in a safe
manner respecting the most common API choices.</p>

<h4>Records and arrays</h4>

<p>Records and arrays are tamed as read-only objects. Therefore, if you tame the record:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var f = {
  x: 3,
  y: 4
};

/* then provide to guest code: */
{ tamedF: aFrameGroup.tame(f) }
</pre>

<p>guest code using the tamed form <code>tamedF</code> will be able to read
the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, but will not be able
to modify them:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint guestcode">
print(tamedF.x);
print(tamedF.y);
tamedF.x = 42;   // Error
tamedF.foo = 19; // Error
</pre>

<p><strong>TODO(ihab.awad):</strong> Add a unit test for arrays!</p>

<h4>Functions</h4>

<p>Functions are tamed as pure functions that are not supplied with a
<code>this</code> variable. This means that, if you tame the function:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function f(x) { alert(this); alert(x); }
var t = aFrameGroup.tame(f);
</pre>

<p>guest code using the tamed form <code>t</code> will be able to call
your function, pass it arguments, and receive its returned
value. However, the <code>this</code> value seen by your code will be
a useless, empty record provided by Caja. The reason is that a
function which modifies its <code>this</code> could be used by
malicious guest code as a tool to manipulate objects that the guest
code would not otherwise have had the authority to manipulate, and it
is not common for JavaScript functions to check the progeny of their
<code>this</code> variable on each invocation.</p>

<h4>Recursion</h4>

<p>Caja recursively traverses records and arrays and tames the values
found inside them.  Arguments passed from guest code to host functions
are un-tamed, then the return value of the host function is tamed.</p>

<h3>Modifying the automatic taming</h3>

<h4><code>markReadWrite</code></h4>

<p>This annotation on a record tells Caja to allow guest code to both
read <em>and</em> write the properties of that record. Only that
record is affected -- not any other object that may be connected to
it. For example, in the following:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var f = { x: 3 };
aFrameGroup.markReadWrite(f);
var t = aFrameGroup.tame(f);
</pre>

<p>guest code using the tamed value <code>t</code> would be allowed to
modify the value of <code>x</code> or delete the property, or add a
new property <code>y</code>.</p>

<h4><code>markXo4a</code></h4>

<p>This annotation on a function tells Caja to tame a function as an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophora">exophora</a>, meaning,
a function that receives any <code>this</code> value it is called
on. For example, in the following:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function f(x) { this.i___ = x; }
aFrameGroup.markXo4a(f);

/* then provide to guest code: */
{ tamedF: aFrameGroup.tame(f) }
</pre>

<p>guest code using the function <code>t</code> would be able to set
the property <code>i___</code> on <em>any</em> object of its choosing,
regardless of any policies to the contrary, even though
<code>i___</code> is not an allowed property name in Caja and would
interfere with the Caja internals. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint guestcode">
var aVictimObject = /* ... */;
aVictimObject.method = tamedF;
aVictimObject.method( /* ... */ );
</pre>

<p>The rule for when an exophora is safe is that it <em>only</em> gets
or sets whitelisted properties of the <code>this</code> value on which
it is called, in other words, properties that do not interfere with
the Caja internals.</p>

<p>In general, true reasons for using exophora are rare. We advise the
use of other, safer mechanisms, with exophora as a last resort.</p>

<h4><code>markCtor</code> and <code>markConstructed</code></h4>

<p>These annotations exist to support the common pattern of
class-based inheritance in JavaScript. Consider the following host
code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function Ctor(x) { this.x = x; }
Ctor.prototype.getX = function() { return this.x; };
Ctor.prototype.setX = function(x) { this.x = x; };

function SubCtor(x, y) { Ctor.call(this, x); this.y = y; }
SubCtor.prototype = new Ctor(0);
SubCtor.prototype.getY = function() { return this.y; };
SubCtor.prototype.setY = function(y) { this.y = y; };
</pre>

<p>In a case where <code>Ctor</code> and <code>SubCtor</code> are to
be made available to guest code, it is necessary to annotate them so
that Caja can tame them correctly. Each constructor must be marked
with <code>markCtor</code> and, if a constructor has a superclass,
that must be provided as the second argument to
<code>markCtor</code>. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
aFrameGroup.markCtor(Ctor);
aFrameGroup.markCtor(SubCtor, Ctor);

/* then provide to guest code: */
{ TamedCtor: tame(Ctor),
  TamedSubCtor: tame(SubCtor) }
</pre>

<p>When guest code creates instances of these constructors, e.g., by calling:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint guestcode">
var o = new TamedCtor(19);
</pre>

<p>Caja will ensure that the instances, like <code>o</code> in the
example, are tamed correctly. In some cases, <em>host</em> code will
need to construct an instance of some constructor, then pass that back
to guest code. In that case, host code must mark the instance using
<code>markConstructed</code> so that Caja can tame it properly. For
example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function makeInstance(x) {
  var o = new Ctor(x);
  aFrameGroup.markConstructed(o);
  return o;
}

/* then provide to guest code: */
{ tamedMakeInstance: tame(makeInstance) }
</pre>
